**Purpose:** Return a new array where _every_ occurrence of the specified value has been removed from the specified input array.

**Signature:**
```
input value:       anyarray, anyelement
return value:      anyarray
```
**Note:** This function requires the array from which values are to be removed is one-dimensional. This restriction is easily understood in light of the fact that arrays are rectilinearâ€”in other words, the geometry of an array whose dimensionality is two or more is fixed at creation time. For examples illustrating this rule, see [`array_fill()`](.././array-fill).

**Example:**
```postgresql
create table t(k int primary key, arr int[]);
insert into t(k, arr)
values (1, '{1, 2, 2, 2, 5, 6}'::int[]);

select arr as "old value of arr" from t where k = 1;

update t
set arr = array_remove(arr, 2)
where k = 1;

select arr as "new value of arr" from t where k = 1;
```
This is the result of the two queries:
```
 old value of arr 
------------------
 {1,2,2,2,5,6}

 new value of arr 
------------------
 {1,5,6}
```

The example suffers from the problem that [GitHub Issue #4296](https://github.com/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/issues/4296) tracks. (This same issue also affects the concatenation operator and the `array_replace()` function.) If you run this example as presented, then the `UPDATE` statement causes an error that causes the client session to terminate. But, when you restart it, an attempt to execute the _"new value of arr"_ query causes an error.

This section will be updated when the issue is fixed. You can sidestep the problem, for demonstration purposes, simply by creating `table t` without a primary key constraint. But this violates proper practice. Here is a viable workaround. Simply use this `UPDATE` statement instead of the one shown above:

```postgresql
with v as (
  select array_remove(arr, 2) as new_arr from t where k = 1)
update t
set arr = (select new_arr from v)
where k = 1;
```
