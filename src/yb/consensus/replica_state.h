// Class that coordinates access to the replica state (independently of Role).
// This has a 1-1 relationship with RaftConsensus and is essentially responsible for
// keeping state and checking if state changes are viable.
//
// Note that, in the case of a LEADER role, there are two configuration states that
// that are tracked: a pending and a committed configuration. The "active" state is
// considered to be the pending configuration if it is non-null, otherwise the
// committed configuration is the active configuration.
//
// When a replica becomes a leader of a configuration, it sets the pending configuration to
// a new configuration declaring itself as leader and sets its "active" role to LEADER.
// It then starts up ConsensusPeers for each member of the pending configuration and
// tries to push a new configuration to the peers. Once that configuration is
// pushed to a majority of the cluster, it is considered committed and the
// replica flushes that configuration to disk as the committed configuration.
//
// Each time an operation is to be performed on the replica the appropriate LockFor*()
// method should be called. The LockFor*() methods check that the replica is in the
// appropriate state to perform the requested operation and returns the lock or return
// Status::IllegalState if that is not the case.
